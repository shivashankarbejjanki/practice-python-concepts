# Python COLLECTIONS;

'''There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

>>>LIST is a collection which is "ordered" and "changeable". Allows duplicate members.
>>>TUPLE is a collection which is "ordered" and "unchangeable". Allows duplicate members.
>>>SET is a collection which is "unordered", "unchangeable" and "unindexed". No duplicate members.
>>>DICTIONARY is a collection which is "ordered" and "changeable". No duplicate members.'''

# Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
# As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
