        <h2>My dear girl!</h2> <br>
        <p>On this beautiful day, Propose Day, I find myself searching for the perfect words to express something that has been in my heart for a long time.</p>
            <p>Words are, after all, so limited when it comes to conveying the depth of my feelings for you, but I’m going to try my best.</p>
            <p>Though we met online, our connection feels real and deep, just as genuine as if we had met in person.</p>
            <p>It's amazing how we can share our thoughts, dreams, and emotions so openly, despite the distance that lies between us.</p>
            <p>I feel like I’ve found someone who truly understands me,</p>
            <p>On this special day, I want to express something that I’ve been feeling for a while now.</p>
            <p>In this world of endless possibilities, I am thankful that we found each other.</p>
            <p>I know that distance may separate us physically, but emotionally, I feel more connected to you every day.</p>
